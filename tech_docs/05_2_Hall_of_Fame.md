# 5.2 Hall of Fame (Competitive Leaderboards)

The **Hall of Fame** is the social and competitive core of the platform, celebrating the most dedicated and skilled players. Rankings are divided into three high-impact categories: **HOT**, **Competitive**, and **Long-Term mastery**.

## 1. HOT: The Activity Engine
This section tracks real-time intensity and daily discipline.
- **Top Today**: Resets every midnight. It highlights players who have earned the most Skill Points within the current 24-hour window.
- **Skill Streaks (+100 Daily)**: Recognizes players who consistently earn at least 100 Skill Points every single day. Missing one day resets the streak.
- **Elite Tornado Streaks (+300 Daily)**: Reserved for the absolute elite who solve vast amounts of Tornado puzzles (300+ points) every day.

## 2. Competitive: Mode-Specific Rankings
Each training mode has its own dedicated leaderboard system, allowing specialists to shine.
- **Tornado (Glicko-2)**: Separate ratings for **Bullet**, **Blitz**, **Rapid**, and **Classic**. These are dynamic ratings calculated based on puzzle difficulty and speed.
- **Thematic Mastery (Advantage/Theory/Practical)**: High-impact tables categorized by theme (e.g., Pawn Endgames, Tactical Skewers).
  - Users can browse records per theme using an interactive ribbon.
  - **Challenge Mode**: From the leaderboard, users can directly "Challenge" a specific record by playing the exact same puzzle to beat the established time.

## 3. Hall of Fame: Overall Skill
The definitive ranking of "Chess Power" on the platform.
- **Skill Points Calculation**: 
  - **Finish Him**: Points equal the material sum on the board (♟=1, ♞♝=3, ♜=5, ♛=9).
  - **Tornado**: 1 point per solved puzzle.
- **Time Periods**: Rankings can be filtered by the last 7, 14, 21, or 30 days, preventing the leaderboard from becoming "stagnant" and giving new users a chance to reach the top.

## 4. Professional Transparency
All records are linked directly to the player's **Lichess Profile**, ensuring authenticity and allowing the community to verify the strength of the top contributors.
