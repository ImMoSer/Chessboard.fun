# 4. Game Modes & Features (Details)

The platform offers a variety of specialized modes designed to target specific areas of chess improvement. These modes are broadly categorized into **Training Environments** (Active practice) and **Study Studios** (Theoretical analysis).

## Core Philosophy
Every mode is built with the "Grandmaster's Training" in mind:
- **Active Learning**: Instead of just watching, the user must play through positions.
- **Engine Verification**: Every response is verified in real-time by professional-grade engines.
- **Realistic Resistance**: Training against "human-like" opponents (Maia) or "perfect" opponents (Stockfish) depending on the goal.
