# ♟️ Chessboard.fun — Professional Chess Training Ecosystem

**Bridge the gap between amateur play and Grandmaster-level preparation.**

**Chessboard.fun** is a high-performance interactive platform designed for chess enthusiasts who seek a disciplined, professional-grade training environment. We combine deep engine-backed analysis with realistic, human-like AI resistance to transform study into a repeatable, high-impact skill.

## 🚀 The Vision: Depth over Simplicity

> "I've always dreamed of a tool that doesn't just show you the engine's best move, but teaches you how to *find* it, *convert* it, and *memorize* it." — **Moser**, Project Architect

Most chess platforms focus on casual play or simple puzzles. **Chessboard.fun** is different. We believe that true improvement requires:
- **Analytical Depth**: Every position is verified by a distributed cluster of elite engines.
- **Human-Centric AI**: We use specialized neural networks (Maia) to simulate the mistakes, traps, and "stubbornness" of real human opponents.
- **The Memorization Loop**: It's not enough to find a brilliant move once; our "Secure" system ensures you internalize the logic forever.

## 💎 Flagship Features

### 🥇 Diamond Hunter (The Killer Feature)
Stop relying on luck to find brilliant moves. 
- **The "Hunt & Secure" Loop**: Find a Diamond (`!!`), refute the bot's blunder, and then **replay the entire game from memory** to secure your achievement.
- **Gravity Map Guidance**: Visualize tactical tension with real-time arrow-based gravity mapping and "Distance" metrics.

### 📊 Tactical Fingerprint (User Cabinet)
Raw data transformed into actionable insights via **Apache ECharts**.
- **Nightingale Rose Charts**: A visual DNA of your tactical strengths and weaknesses across dozens of themes (Pins, Forks, X-Rays, etc.).
- **Mastery Ladder**: Stacked column charts tracking your progress through three tiers (**Novice**, **Pro**, **Master**) in every endgame and opening category.
