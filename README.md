## üë®‚Äçüíª About the Author

Hello! My name is **Moser**. I was born in 1985 in Kazakhstan and have been living in Germany since 2003.

By trade, I'm a mechanical engineer, but I've been passionate about chess my whole life. This project is a long-held dream of mine to create a convenient training tool, which became possible thanks to modern technologies like AI and the n8n platform.

I am fluent in Russian and German, and also know some English.

Thank you for using Chessboard.fun!
